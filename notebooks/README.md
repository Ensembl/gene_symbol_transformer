# development Jupyter notebooks

The notebooks are saved using [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) as Python scripts. Jupytext can open the scripts in Jupyter and generate notebooks or [create them from the command line](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#can-i-create-a-notebook-from-a-text-file).
